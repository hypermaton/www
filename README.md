hypermaton referring to the term "hyperautomation," which is a business-driven, disciplined approach identified by Gartner that organizations use to rapidly identify, vet and automate as many business and IT processes as possible.

Hyperautomation involves the orchestrated use of multiple technologies, tools or platforms, including:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
- Advanced analytics
- Business process management (BPM)

The idea behind hyperautomation is to increase AI decision making, drastically reduce the need for human intervention in the automation process, and ultimately enable more complex and nuanced automation.
It is an expanded concept from RPA and is expected to have a significant impact on all areas of business operations.
